Logistic Regression is a machine learning method used for classification, mainly yes/no type problems.

Even though its name has “regression”, it is actually a classification algorithm.

Simple idea:
Logistic regression predicts the probability that something belongs to a class, then decides the class based on that probability.

Example:

Will a student pass or fail?

Email is spam or not spam?

Person has a disease yes or no?

The output is a value between 0 and 1.

Close to 1 → Yes

Close to 0 → No

A common rule:

Probability ≥ 0.5 → Class 1 (Yes)

Probability < 0.5 → Class 0 (No)

How it works (easy explanation):

The model takes input features (like study hours).

It calculates a score.

This score is passed through a sigmoid function.

The sigmoid converts the score into a probability (0 to 1).

Based on the probability, the final class is chosen.

Why sigmoid is important:

It keeps output between 0 and 1

Makes decision easy

Why logistic regression is useful:

Simple and fast

Easy to understand

Works well for linearly separable data

Gives probability as output

Limitations:

Not good for complex non-linear data

Needs feature scaling for best results

In one line:
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a class using the sigmoid function.
