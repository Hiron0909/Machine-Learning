Decision Tree Regression is a method used to predict a number (not a category).
Example: house price, exam marks, salary, temperature.

Think of it like asking questions step by step.

Imagine you want to predict house price.

The model asks simple questions like:

Is the house size greater than 1000 sq ft?

Is the number of rooms more than 3?

Based on the answers, the data is split into smaller groups.

Each split tries to put similar values together.

At the end of the tree, there is no more question.
That final point is called a leaf node.

👉 In a leaf node, the model stores the average value of the target.

So:

If a leaf has house prices: 50k, 52k, 48k

The prediction will be their average = 50k

How prediction works:

Input goes from the top of the tree

Follows the yes/no questions

Reaches a leaf

Output is the average value at that leaf

Why it is easy:

No formulas needed

Works like real-life decisions

Easy to understand and explain

One important drawback:

If the tree becomes too large, it can memorize data (overfitting)

In one line:
Decision Tree Regression predicts a number by splitting data using simple questions and returning the average value at the end.

If you want, I can also explain it using a small table example or simple diagram idea.
