Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of machine learning and artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Since human language is unstructured and complex, NLP helps machines convert text or speech into a form that algorithms can analyze and learn from. The main goal of NLP is to allow computers to interact with humans in a natural and meaningful way.

In NLP, raw text is first processed so that a machine can understand it. This step is called text preprocessing and includes tasks such as tokenization (splitting text into words), removing stop words (common words like “is” or “the”), and stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base form). These steps help reduce noise and make the data easier for machine learning models to handle.

After preprocessing, the text must be converted into numerical features, because machine learning models work with numbers, not words. Common techniques include Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe. These methods represent text in a way that captures word importance and, in advanced methods, word meaning and context.

NLP is used for many important tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, spam detection, and chatbots. Modern NLP systems often use deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers to understand context and relationships between words. Overall, NLP plays a key role in making machines capable of understanding and communicating using human language.
