Apriori is an association rule learning algorithm used to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules from large transactional datasets. It is widely used in market basket analysis.

Basic idea (Apriori principle):

If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.
Conversely, if an itemset is infrequent, none of its supersets can be frequent. This principle helps reduce unnecessary calculations.

How Apriori works:
First, the algorithm scans the dataset to find frequent 1-itemsets (items whose support is above a minimum threshold).
Next, these frequent itemsets are combined to form larger itemsets (2-itemsets, 3-itemsets, and so on).
After each combination step, itemsets that do not meet minimum support are removed.
This process continues until no more frequent itemsets can be found.
Finally, association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets using minimum confidence.

Key parameters:

Minimum Support: Filters out rare itemsets

Minimum Confidence: Filters out weak rules

Lift (optional): Measures strength of a rule

Example:
If {Milk, Bread} appears frequently in transactions and the rule
Milk → Bread
has high confidence, Apriori will keep this rule.

Advantages:
It is simple, easy to understand, and effective for small to medium datasets.

Limitations:
It requires multiple database scans, can be slow for large datasets, and may generate many candidate itemsets.
