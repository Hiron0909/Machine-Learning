Eclat (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal) is an association rule mining algorithm used to find frequent itemsets in transactional datasets. Like Apriori, it is used in association rule learning, but it works in a different and often faster way.

Basic idea:
Eclat uses a vertical data format instead of the horizontal format used by Apriori.
Each item is stored with a TID-set (Transaction ID set), which contains the IDs of transactions where the item appears.
The support of an itemset is calculated by intersecting TID-sets, not by scanning the database repeatedly.

How Eclat works:
First, the dataset is converted into vertical format (item → list of transaction IDs).
Then, frequent 1-itemsets are found using minimum support.
Next, larger itemsets are generated by intersecting TID-sets of smaller itemsets.
If the size of the intersection meets minimum support, the itemset is frequent.
This process continues using a depth-first search approach until no more frequent itemsets can be generated.

Why Eclat is faster:
It avoids repeated database scans and computes support efficiently using set intersections.

Advantages:
It is faster than Apriori for many datasets, uses efficient support counting, and is suitable for dense datasets.

Limitations:
It can use a lot of memory due to storing TID-sets and is less suitable for very large or sparse datasets.
